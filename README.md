# Clicker
A simple mouse clicker to use on windows computers.  
To use, install Visual Studio with C++, then create a project and put the `Source.cpp` file in the project.  
In case you need an AFK mob killing thing for Minecraft, press <kbd>S</kbd> when it asks for which mouse button you want to press. (Forgot what the S stood for :D)  
Planned to work on a system for AFK fishing in 1.16, will get to that when I get time.
