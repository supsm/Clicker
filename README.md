# Clicker
A simple mouse clicker to use on windows computers.  
  
To use, simply download the file `Clicker.exe` and run it. The source code is also available for download as `Source.cpp`. Pretty sure you'll need Visual Studio to compile it though.
  
In case you need an AFK mob killing thing for Minecraft, press <kbd>S</kbd> when it asks for which mouse button you want to press. (Forgot what the S stood for :D)  
Planned to work on a system for AFK fishing in 1.16, will get to that when I get time.
